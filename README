## 📈 Modeling Approach

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values
   - Remove outliers
   - Feature engineering

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Distribution plots
   - Price trends by location and features

3. **Modeling**
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Evaluation using RMSE and R²

4. **Results**
   - Random Forest performed best with R² ≈ 0.89
   - Key predictors: sqft_living, grade, location, bathrooms
